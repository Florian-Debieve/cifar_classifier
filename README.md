**CIFAR10 Classifier**

In this github repository you will find the flask application made with the classifier trained using the CIFAR10 dataset. The training process of this classifier is detailed there: https://github.com/Florian-Debieve/datascience_projects/blob/main/cifar_10.ipynb

So that this application works, it is necessary to add the "static" folder that contains the models composing the classifier. This folder can be found there: https://www.mediafire.com/file/704jtj0zbuykw3f/static.rar/file
